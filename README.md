# Zork
A toy python zork for AP CSP

# How to Play
Run main.py in order to play the game. The game will provide information to you and will ask you want you'd like to do. The things you are allowed to input is pretty limited, since there isn't a proper natural language processor in the source (too much work!). If something says invalid action, try slight variations, usually with less words, since we tried to do things as simply as possible.

The game has 7 rooms which you can look around and explore. If you exit the house, the game will end, since you won. You may need to pick up items in order to look around the house.

# Hint
Starting hint: You need to turn around a bit in order to see your way in the basement...
